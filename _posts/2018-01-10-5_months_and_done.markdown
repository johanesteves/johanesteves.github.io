Wow, its been 5 months in this incredible journey and I can't believe its almost over. Soon I'll be done with the Flatiron course and be able to move on to the job search process. I had thought it would have taken me about 8 months or so but was determined and excited by the content really lit a fire under me. There were plenty of highs and lows throughout the process. I remember getting stuck on a lab and staying up late to try to figure it out. I eventually gave up for the day, woke up the next day and figured out the solution. Turns out most of the time you just need to take a break or clear your head. 

I can't believe how fast these past few months went by. I remember spending hours on the Ruby labs and Tic Tac Toe lab. Now I can say I can get a Rails app up and running within a few minutes. I am excited for the new career that Flatiron has give me and can't wait to get started. 

The amount of support from other students,  instructors and coaches have been incredible and I can't say thank you enough. I hope to have the same support throughout the career process as well.

Thank you, Flatiron.
