As I continue on my programming journey, tools I used and grew to love had begun to evolve into larger tools with advanced features that cause me to re-evaluate how I  coded. 

This was how I felt moving from Sinatra to Rails. 

# Rails simplifies everything! Maybe....
I had grown to really enjoy Sinatra, the keystrokes of setting up my routes were engraved into my fingers. I was something I had spent the last month doing and the more I set up Sinatra apps, the faster I got at debugging code. 

Now was time to move on the Rails, the infamous framework. As I went learning the basics, everything seemed so simple. It was more or less the same the was taught during the Sinatra section. Except the set up was a little bit different. The syntax of setting routes had changed. Routes instead were stored in a routes.rb file. 

Your controllers had methods with the names of the RESTful routes and it could autodetect which view to render by ensuring you had the correct view file (ie. index.html.erb). 

While this may have sounded amazing if I had learned Rails first, it was definitely a learning curve for someone coming from Sinatra. It was the little things that threw curveballs when coding, but it was still exciting.

# Getting used to you, Rails
Now a week into Rails, I have been adjusting steadily. I stopped thinking it was Sinatra and had my mind set on Rails. I started to see how powerful it was. 

Rails generator was an incredible tool. While I was always tempted to use the generate scaffold, I stuck to using generate migrate and model to ensure I wasn't created extra files that I may never use.

It almost felt like cheating, having someone else do your homework, but I could see why Rails was so popular.

# Final Project
As I started my first Rails Final Project, I found that I had grown to really enjoy Rails as much as I enjoyed Sinatra. No one likes change, but learning something new and powerful is always exciting. 

While I still have a ton to learn about Rails, I saw how useful and powerful it was and was excited to keep learning.

I was able to create a Workout App that allowed users to create workouts, exercises and track them. I also used the omniauth-github gem to allow users to log in via Github. Such a cool feature, implemented by me, the coder.
