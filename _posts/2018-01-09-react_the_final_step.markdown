On to the final step of my final step of my Flatiron curriculum. It seems like it flew by right before my eyes. The late nights and early morning of looking at code as come together for my final project. While I finish my ciricculiam, I look to start a new chapter in the process. One of the hardest, job searching. 

Beforing getting there, I have React & Redux in my path.
