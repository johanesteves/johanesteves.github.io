On to the final step of my final step of my Flatiron curriculum. It seems like it flew by right before my eyes. The late nights and early morning of looking at code as come together for my final project. While I finish my curriculum, I look to start a new chapter in the process. One of the hardest, job searching. 

Before getting there, I had React & Redux in my path. 

## Learning React

Going through the basics of React, I seem to understand it quite easily. Learning props, events, and state, all made seems quite easy to me. 

Props are ways to pass values to your React components. In some cases, you will want to pass an array or collection of items so the component can then render each item on a separate card. In addition, you can also add defaults to your props.

States are the data of the component. It is data that can be changed over the lifecycle and can come from external sources. While you can get props and state mixed up if the data will ever change it should be stated. State is key to component especially when users begin interacting with your app as you may want to change the data based on what the user is doing.

While these are the basics of React, I believe understanding these are the building blocks as more complex ideas get built on to the concept of Props and State. 

## Final Project

For my final project, I decided to create a Board Game Collection app. This app was built with the react front end and a Rails API backend. Rails would hold the data in the database and also allow users to access certain data through the API request. In the case,  my frontend React app would be the one making API calls to Rails backend. 

Before starting, I could not understand how to implement React and Rails into one app. They both seemed like separate apps. I watched a few videos and got a better understanding of how to use Rails (API) to serve the data to a React app.

My board game collection app allows you to view a collection of board games that you have added as well as add new ones. If the new one is added, you will be redirected back to the main collection view and see your newly added board game. 

The other feature is a search bar feature which in real-time will provide you the results as you type in the text. No need to wait for the page to load, the results will automatically appear on a screen.

The search bar was one of the exciting parts of React as you could see its benefits clearly. React is able to make a GET request as the text in the search bar changes and display that to users almost instantly. 

## Conclusion

While there many times I got stuck while building my final project app, I learned a lot on how React works and began understanding their best practices. I was excited to finally see a visually appealing app that had a lot of "fancy" features like making GET requests without having to load the whole page again. I was excited to keep learning more about React.
